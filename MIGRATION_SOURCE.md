Fabushi iOS is a standalone downstream port of Desktop PR #20. Source may be reused, ported, translated, or adapted into this repository, but the iOS product must not require another Fabushi source checkout or a new shared Desktop/iOS runtime repository.

Grok Bot 0.18 is historical architecture/provenance context through Desktop PR #20. It is no longer the direct iOS migration authority.

The current Desktop `frontend/** + source/**` inventory contains 7,943 source-bearing paths at the pinned exact HEAD. Chunk `sourceCommit` fields record the provenance SHA of each materialized snapshot; the top-level manifest/ledger authority and each changed blob identity are the exact-current acceptance boundary.
